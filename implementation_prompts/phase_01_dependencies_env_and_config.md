You are working on the Wijaiwai / Research Workbench codebase.

Global v3 decisions:
- Keep SQLite. Do not migrate to PostgreSQL.
- Keep OpenAlex using `.env` variables `OPEN_ALEX_API_KEY` and `OPEN_ALEX_BASE_URL`.
- Reference Vault contains only uploaded papers and OpenAlex-imported paper metadata.
- Remove Notes and Web Scraping from active product scope.
- Use Docling for PDF/scanned PDF to Markdown.
- Use LlamaIndex + Pinecone for RAG.
- Use OpenThaiGPT for Workbench citation analysis.
- Render citations as `[author_name, paper_name]`.
- UI is 3 panels: left Reference Vault, middle Workbench, right Chat Assistant.

Read first if present:
- AGENTS.md
- docs/codex_reviews/v3_sqlite_openalex_docling_preflight_review.md
- _context_packs/*.md

Prior review context to verify:
- app.py was main Streamlit UI.
- database.py was SQLite-based.
- Notes/Web were active.
- web_scraper was imported.
- upload supported PDF/TXT/DOCX/DOC.
- Pinecone was already used.
- citation output was [Author, Year].

Hard rules:
- Make smallest safe change.
- Preserve function names where possible.
- Do not rewrite whole app.
- Run py_compile or smallest relevant check.

# Phase 01 — Dependencies, Environment, Config

Add minimal config/dependency support for Docling, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, and OpenAlex env vars.

Expected:
- update requirements.txt or equivalent
- add `.env.example` entries if project has it
- add config loader for `OPEN_ALEX_API_KEY`, `OPEN_ALEX_BASE_URL`
- no full OpenAlex client yet
- no UI changes yet
